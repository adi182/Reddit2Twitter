Reddit2Twitter
=======

This twitter bot was inspired by Yasoob's [Reddit-Twitter bot](https://github.com/yasoob/Reddit-Twitter-bot). Check him out, Yasoob has some great materials for learning python!

I noticed that due to some changes in how Twitter and Google handling url shortening, Yasoob's bot was no longer funtional. I started making this variation long before I learned about pull requests, and it's expanded further in scope somewhat.

The goal of Reddit2Twitter is to automate th movement of content from a subreddit to a twitter account. This is ideal if you manage a community on twitter, and want to make your subreddit's content immediately availble to an audiance on Twitter. Reddit2Twitter also provides some additional customablity to help facilitate this.
